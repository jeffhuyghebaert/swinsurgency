This is a Star Wars game. We may disagree about which Star Wars movies and shows we love and which we are not so fond of, but we all love Star Wars. Mature discussions about merits flaws, and preferences are fine, but mocking of other players for their preferences will not be permitted. Constant bashing of actors, directors, producers, films, etc, is also strongly discouraged.
