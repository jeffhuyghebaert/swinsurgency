We do not permit OOC harassment, threats, or bullying based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, beliefs, ethnicity, nation or planet of origin, or any other reason.

If you feel you are being harassed by another player, please bring your concerns to a staff member right away. If you can log the encounter, please give staff an unedited copy of that log.

If you choose to harass, threaten, or bully someone on this game, please know that you will be banned, no matter who you are or how much you contribute to RP.

In cases where the behavior is borderline or possibly misinterpreted, we will in these cases only use a one strike and you're out policy. Second incidents after warning will result in a ban.
