SW: Insurgency is a consent-based game, and players are required to respect the consent of other players.

What is consent? Consent means that a player has the right to refuse certain actions and activities based on their wishes and comfort level in the context of a given situation. No player is required to play out scenes which they are not comfortable with, or simply do not wish to play. Consent also means that players must be able to make informed decisions about their character's actions and consequences, though it does *not* mean that they are able to outright refuse the consequences of their actions. 

For example, if a wanted Rebel PC approaches an Imperial officer, the GM will inform the player that this may result in their character either coming to harm, being taken prisoner, or possibly even death. The player can then make an informed decision about whether or not to follow through with that action. If they choose to do so, they accept the consequences of that action, and cannot avoid being shot at, taken prisoner, or even killed depending on how the scene unfolds, though they may choose not to play out the specifics of those consequences on-screen. Nevertheless, the character will still suffer whatever consequences the GM decides are appropriate. Consent cannot be used to save your character from the consequences of situations you knowingly and willfully entered into.

If a scene is not being actively GM'd by a staffer or a staff-designated GM, it is up to the players to determine when consent is needed, and what consequences are appropriate for a given action. Staff will not enforce consequences for non-GM'd scenes, however be aware that consistently flouting the spirit of ICA = ICC (in-character actions equal in-character consequences) will likely result in other players not including you in scenes, and potentially, your being asked to find another game to join.
