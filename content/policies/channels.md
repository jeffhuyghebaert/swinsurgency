Please use com channels for their proper purposes only. Information on what the channels are for can be found in their descriptions. Except when expressly noted, channels are OOC and rated PG-13/R. If you are asked to take a conversation to another channel by a staffer, please do so. Please do not be offended by the request, and do not argue. If you are asked to stop bringing up a topic on-com by a staffer, you must comply without argument. If you are not a staffer, do not police the channels, but please come to staff with your concerns and we will take care of the situation. Understand that personally not enjoying a topic of discussion is not a reason to take it off a channel.

NO CHANNELS WHATSOEVER may be used for harassment, solicitation of money or sex, illegal activities, acquisition of drugs, threats of real life violence, legal advice, medical advice, or therapy.

Failure to use the public com system appropriately will result in being asked to leave.
