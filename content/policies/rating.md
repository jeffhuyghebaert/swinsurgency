Star Wars: Insurgency is an R-rated game, intended for adult audiences. Younger viewers, or those with delicate sensibilities may be offended. This game is not for those people. This game is intended to be gritty and violent. In roleplay, you should expect to see strong language, adult themes, sexuality, and violence beyond what is portrayed in the films. We do ask, however, that roleplay logs be edited to remove explicit sexual activity prior to posting.

Public discussion, in both the OOC Lounge and the public channels, is expected to be kept to PG-13, though stronger language is accepted. If you need to discuss more explicit subjects, you are welcome to take it to private pages, or make use of the X-Rated channel, where (almost) anything goes.
