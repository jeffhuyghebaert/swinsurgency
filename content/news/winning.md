As players, we generally like it when our characters succeed at what they set out to do. We, as staff, recognize that. But please understand that in these IC times, Rebels almost never "win" and Imperials almost never "lose".

We know this might be frustrating if looked at in terms of winning and losing battles. However, it helps if we really understand what success and failure mean in this era. For Rebels, success means survival, not being captured, and making small-scale gains. For Imperials, failure means letting any spark of rebellion remain uncrushed. Players need to understand that there will be occasions when the Rebels "win" significantly and the Imperials "lose". This is part of Star Wars.

Please keep all of this in mind when creating a character, choosing a faction, and when roleplaying. We're all here to create character stories together. We are not keeping score. There is no tally sheet of wins and losses. Do not complain about your character or your 'side' losing most of the time or not winning all of the time. If winning or losing is critically important to you, you may want to choose another game.
