Players are permitted to have as many characters as they wish, with few restrictions. Players are required to register all of their alternate characters in the same Alt Group upon character creation. Anyone caught purposely avoiding this risks removal from the game.

Players may only have one Force Sensitive character at a time.

The most important rule to follow when it comes to alternate characters is that your characters may not interact in any way, nor share information with one another even indirectly. Avoid alt path-crossing entirely.

To create an alternate character, simply create it at the game login screen.
