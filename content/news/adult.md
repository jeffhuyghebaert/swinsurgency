Look, we're not stupid. We're also not children, or prudes, or puritans. We know that regardless of what we say, people are going to engage in explicit sexual activity online. We're not going to try to stop you. But we ask that you keep your private activities private. And sure, accidents happen, and we can all laugh about it, but if you're caught TSing in a public place, you'll be asked to leave the game. Private rooms exist, so please use them.

We have a zero-tolerance policy for any sexual activity involving minors; if you are under 18 (or the age of consent in your jurisdiction), and are caught engaging in sexual activity, you will be removed from the game. If you are caught roleplaying explicit sexual content involving characters who are minors, you will be removed from the game.

To make a long story short, have your fun, but keep it private and don't do anything illegal.
