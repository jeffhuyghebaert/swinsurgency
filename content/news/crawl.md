The CLONE WARS have been over for five years. The Galactic Republic, which had stood for a thousand years, has fallen, replaced by the humanocentric GALACTIC EMPIRE. The JEDI ORDER is all by destroyed, survived only by a handful of its members, scattered and hiding throughout the galaxy. The IMPERIAL SENATE is little more than political theatre, with no real power or influence. The EMPIRE rules through fear and force, brutally subjugating those who would stand against its tyranny. DARTH VADER and his INQUISITORS leads the charge to hunt down and destroy any and all remaining Jedi, and to quash any hint of REBELLION.

The HUTT CARTELS remain in de facto control of much of the Outer Rim Territories, where the Imperial presence is smaller. The criminal underworld thrives, preying on the weak and vulnerable. In the Core Worlds, the CRIMSON DAWN acts with near impunity, somehow able to operate while avoiding Imperial entanglements. Independent traders continue to eke out their survival moving cargo between worlds, but the Empire's strict regulations and restrictions make it difficult to make an honest living, forcing some to turn to smuggling, stealing, or worse. 

While most citizens of the Galaxy seek to simply to live out their lives in relative peace, reluctantly accepting the harsh rule of the Empire, there will always be those who would stand against tyranny and oppression; small groups of scattered fighters form a loose resistance against the Empire, working to sabotage and disrupt Imperial operations in their home systems, and it is only a matter of time before this fledgling REBELLION grows in strength and numbers.

The Empire cannot last forever.
