Restricted concepts may be apped under the following conditions:

* The concept must be pre-approved by staff via +request
* The concept must be interesting, playable, and not overdone
* The concept must fall within the lines of established canon information with regard to race, culture, etcetera. If you're wanting to play a Gand Findsman for example, don't come with a concept that completely disregards Gand cultural norms; this doesn't mean you have to adhere to them, but it does mean you have to understand them and the consequences for breaking them.

The following concepts are restricted:

* Jedi Knights
* Senators
* Planetary leaders (from planets not on the playable grid)
* Gand Findsmen
* Trained Force-sensitives from other traditions
* Crimelords
* Imperial military characters
* Intelligence Operatives (from either side)
