Dace Keran was born in the Mid-Rim, on a planet you've never heard of. His parents were farmers, and he hated everything about farming, so when he was old enough he got off the planet as soon as possible, and signed on to a freighter. From there he learned the ropes as a pilot and trader, and when he'd earned enough, and learned enough, he bought his own ship and headed off to spaceways to make his fortune. With the rise of the Empire, life as an independent trader became even harder, with new restrictions and laws to work around; Dace eventually turned to smuggling goods for the Hutt Cartel to make even a few credits above his operating costs. Just recently, the Empire landed on his home planet with an occupation force, forcing the farmers there to hand over their crops and lands to Imperial forces; his parents stood up against them, and were killed. Just another reason to hate the Empire.
