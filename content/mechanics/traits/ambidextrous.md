You are as comfortable using your right hand as your left, and do not take a penalty for using your off-hand for actions, as you do not in fact have an 'off-hand'. Your penalty for dual-wielding weapons is reduced to 0D+1 for the first additional action in a round, but is applied as normal for subsequent actions in that round.
