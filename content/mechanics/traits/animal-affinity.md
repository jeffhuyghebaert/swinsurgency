You have a natural affinity for animals. Generally speaking, they like you and you like them. Maybe you even prefer the company of animals over that of your own species. Who are we to judge. Whatever the case, you tend to put animals at ease, and at times even have a natural sense for their emotions and needs. You can't quite 'talk with the animals' but you can read them better than most members of your species.

All difficulty levels when training, taming, or calming animals are reduced by one level. Additionally, if commanding a trained animal, the difficulty to do so is reduced by one level.
