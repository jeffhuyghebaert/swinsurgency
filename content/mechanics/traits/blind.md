You can't see. Period. You either don't have eyes, or they don't work. Maybe you were born with sight, but lost it, or maybe you were born blind. Whatever the case, the visual world is beyond your ability to perceive in all respects.

You take a 3D+0 penalty when performing any action which requires sight under normal circumstances. You cannot read information from a screen or a book unless it has been specially formatted to make use of your other senses.

This is a permanent condition. If you wish to regain your sight (or gain it for the first time) by means of cybernetic implants, optic nerve transplant, or ther means, you must spend a minimum of 15 Character Points per eye. This condition may be overcome by use of the Force Sight power, if your character is eligible to learn it.
