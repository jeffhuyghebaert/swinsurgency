Whether it's intentional or not, you come across as cold and uncaring. Because of your callous presentation, others are less inclined to trust or confide in you, and tend not to believe that you care about their problems whatsoever. You suffer a 1D+0 penalty to any Con or Persuasion rolls where this might be a factor. Additionally, you suffer a 1D+0 penalty to any Command roll, because people are generally reluctant to be led by someone they think doesn't care about them.
