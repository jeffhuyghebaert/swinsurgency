You have a hard time 'cooling off' when you're in a combat situation. When you start fighting, you will keep fighting until all perceived enemies are eliminated with extreme prejudice. To stop fighting before all enemies are eliminated, you must make a Moderate Self-Control roll. If this roll fails, you must wait one full round before making another attempt. This trait also allows you ignore one stun effect every five rounds of combat, however greater wounds will be treated as normal.
