As a specimen of your species you are generally considered to be above-average in the looks department. Those who are attracted to your species and gender (if applicable) will be more attracted to you than the average specimen. Having natural good looks comes with a lot of benefits; you tend to give a better first impression, be more trust-able, less likely to be assumed a villain, and more.

You gain a 0D+2 bonus to social rolls such as con or persuasion where your appearance can be a factor in how others perceive your intentions, when dealing with a being who finds your species and gender attractive.

This trait is primarily intended to be used to gain advantage over non-player characters; any effect your appearance might have on a player character is entirely at their discretion regardless of any rolls.
