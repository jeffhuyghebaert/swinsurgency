You have an innate navigational sense, and practically never get lost. You can find your way out of mazes and tunnels better than most, and you always seem to have an accurate sense of where you are, provided you can see the stars, or find some kind of landmark to orient yourself by. You gain a 1D+0 bonus to Survival and Tracking when finding your way in unknown territory. This sense of direction also lends itself to astrogational calculations, to which you gain a 0D+2 bonus.
