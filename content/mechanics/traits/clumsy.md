You're not graceful, and despite all your attempts to be careful, you're prone to bumping into things, dropping things, tripping on yourself or objects. Not to put too fine a point on it, you're a klutz. You suffer a 2D+0 penalty to any action where care must be taken to avoid breaking something, tripping an alarm, or making exceess noise.
