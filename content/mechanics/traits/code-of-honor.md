You live by a very rigid code. It defines not only how you fight, but also how you live. The specifics of this code are individual to you, but these rules inform every action and decision you make. For example, the Jedi live by a code of honor, as do the Mandalorians; very different codes, but the effect is ultimately the same. You are subject to penalties at the GM's discretion for breaking your code; these penalties might be for a single scene, or reach beyond it at which point staff will become involved.
