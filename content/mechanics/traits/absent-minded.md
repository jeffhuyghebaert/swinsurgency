You are the type that forgets things easily; you don't tend to forget big important things, but relatively small matters often fail to find purchase in your memory for whatever reason. No matter how much you might remind yourself of something ahead of time, some little thing is going to be forgotten, only to be remembered later. Now where did you put your keys?

The GM may randomly decide that you've forgotten some small but important detail of an event, campaign, or operation; this could be a fact, a part of a plan, or an item of importance, at the GM's discretion.
