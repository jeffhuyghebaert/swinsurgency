Character Generation (CharGen) is the process by which you take the idea in your head and create a fully formed character in the context of the game. Character Generation is divided into several steps, and detailed instructions are provided at each step to walk you through the process.

SW: Insurgency uses a variation on the D6 RPG system; if you are unfamiliar with D6, please read through [NEWS SYSTEM](/news/system) for an introduction.

#### Character Generation Overview

##### Basic Information
Set your character's basic information, such as race, gender, age, physical features and description.

##### Force Sensitivity
Choose whether or not to make your character Force Sensitive. You may do so with no penalty, however there are important story factors to consider when making this choice. You may only have one Force Sensitive character at a time.

##### Bonus Selection
You can choose between three different character bonuses: A ship, extra skills, and cybernetic enhancements.

##### Attributes
Set your character's attributes (Awareness, Coordination, Knowledge, Physique, Presence, Reflexes, and if you are Force Sensitive, Force). Every PC gets 18D total attribute dice, including racial minimum attributes.

##### Skills
Set your character's skills. Every character must have at least 8 skills on their sheet, and cannot exceed 2D+0 past the racial attribute maximum. So if the racial attribute maximum is 4D+0, the maximum skill value you can take is 6D+0. Don't worry, because next is...

##### Specializations
Each character may select up to 3 specializations. Specializations allow a character to boost their ability in a specific sub-skill beyond the restrictions imposed in the skills room. For example, someone with the Shoot skill at 6D+0 may take the Blaster specialization to add an additional 1D+0 when using a blaster weapon. Each specialization adds 1D+0, but can only be chosen once. Out of CharGen, players may raise specializations independently of their parent skills, at half the XP cost.

##### Traits
Traits are quirks, advantages, or flaws which can further define your character, and impart bonuses or penalties on a per-trait basis. Traits are completely optional, and are simply an added element to increase character interest.

##### Languages
Pick your languages. You start out with your racial default language, and can pick as many more as you have points in the Language skill.

##### Background
Every character has to come from somewhere, right? We're not looking for Dickens or Chaucer, but your background should tell us who your character is and how they got to where they are, within the context of our theme.

##### Review and Submit
Finally, take a look over everything you've done and make sure you're happy with it before submitting for approval.
