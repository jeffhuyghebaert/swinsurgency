Our game begins 10 years after the formation of the Galactic Empire in the wake of the Clone Wars. Because we are so far ahead of the Battle of Yavin, we use the IE (Imperial Era) dating epoch. For reference, the Clone Wars ended in 19BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin), and this is our year 0 IE.

-2 IE:
* The Republic Senate grants Sheev Palpatine emergency powers to raise an army to fight the Separatist armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the Clone Wars begin.

-1 IE:
* The office of Moff is created to oversee the governance and support of the Republic's 20 Sector Armies. Moffs wielded sweeping powers over their sectors, effectively ruling via martial law with the Chancellor's blessing.
* Fearing for the safety of the Republic's democracy, The Delegation of 2000 creates and submits a petition to Chancellor Palpatine demanding that he relinquish the emergency powers granted to him by the Senate.

0 IE:
* Following a failed attempt by the Jedi to arrest and expose Chancellor Palpatine as a Sith, the Jedi are declared traitors to the Republic, and Palpatine enacts Order 66, causing the Clone Troopers to kill their Jedi commanders.
* Darth Vader arrives at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and kills every youngling and the remaining instructors.
* The Clone Wars are brought to a quick end, as Darth Vader dispatches the Separatist leadership. Using the attack by the Jedi as well the continued threat of holdout Separatist systems, Palpatine announces that he will reform the failed Republic into a Galactic Empire, and proclaimed himself its Emperor.
* The Republic Senate is replaced with the Galactic Senate, and its legislative and oversight powers are quickly reduced; it exists largely in an advisory capacity, with little power to enforce legislation.
* 63 Senators, all members of the Delegation of 2000, are arrested on charges of conspiracy and treason against the Empire. Most are executed; Mon Mothma and Bail Organa are released following their declaration of loyalty to the Empire.
* The Imperial military is greatly expanded, under the auspices of continuing to rout and suppress any lingering CIS remnants in the Outer Rim. Imperial forces quickly establish garrisons and military presence in strategically valuable systems.
* Imperial forces arrive on the planet Raada to mass-harvest the planet's food sources, which all but destroys the planet's agricultural capabilities. An uprising against the Imperial occupation is organized, and rumoured to be led by a former Jedi who survived Order 66. The uprising ultimately fails when a first-strike is launched prematurely; the instigators are executed, but the alleged unnamed Jedi disappears.
* The planet Kashyyyk is blockaded by Imperial forces, and the Wookiee population is declared legal slaves of the Empire. Kashyyyk is re-designated Imperial Territory G5-623, and the Wookiees are forced to harvest the planet's resources to fuel and supply Imperial armies.
* The Free Ryloth movement is founded on the planet Ryloth to oppose Imperial occupation of the planet following the Empire's refusal to leave due to its valuable spice and mineral resources.

1 IE:
* The Imperial Inquisitorius is formed from a small number of former Jedi and Padawans who were successfully turned to the Dark Side, and tasked with hunting down any remaining Jedi, as well as Jedi artifacts.
* Grand Moff Tarkin is ordered to make an example of the population of Antar 4, as punishment for the planet's allegiance to the CIS during the Clone Wars. Tarkin carries out a brutal campaign of mass arrests and executions; following this event, hundreds of former Separatist worlds a persuaded to voluntarily turn over any and all former Separatists and sympathizers to the Empire.
* The planet Caamas experiences wide-spread natural disasters, eventually causing the world's planetary defence shield to malfunction. This malfunction results in planet-wide ion storms, devastating the planet's population, and rendering the surface largely uninhabitable. Imperial forces arrive too late for an effective evacuation. Imperial sabotage is suspected, given the Caamasi Senator's involvement in the Delegation of 2000, but none is ever proven.
* The Partisan faction is formed on Onderon under the leadership of Saw Gerrara, beginning a guerrilla campaign of armed resistance against the Empire. Inspired by the Gerrara, small groups of resistance fighters crop up throughout Imperial space. Most of rooted out and destroyed by Imperial counter-insurgency efforts.
* Mon Cala is subjugated by the Empire after its government refuses its terms for Imperial control. Massive numbers of Mon Calamari escape the planet during the transition, taking huge converted city-ships into the Unknown Reaches and out of reach of the Empire. The remaining Mon Calamari and Quarren population are declared legal slaves of the Empire, and forced to turn Mon Cala's extensive shipyards toward the production of the Imperial fleet.

2 IE:
* The Mandalore system is occupied by Imperial forces, and an Imperial-backed coup on Mandalore ousts the ruling Clan, replacing it with Clan Saxon as the de facto ruler of the world. Clan Saxon allies itself closely with the Empire, and an Imperial Academy is constructed on Mandalore.
* The Western Reaches Operation begins, in order to rout the remaining CIS forces from the Western Reaches region of the galaxy. The two-year campaign is a military success, and a boon to the public perception of the Empire, particularly in the Core Worlds.
* The Imperial Security Bureau is formed as a secret police organization, dedicated to rooting out enemies of the Empire and maintaining stability throughout Imperial territories.

4 IE:
* The planet Lasan is invaded by Imperial forces after the Last challenged Imperial control of their world. The Empire engaged in a campaign to wipe out the Lasat species, and are very nearly eradicated. The surface of Lasan is razed, leaving it largely uninhabitable, and only a handful of surviving Lasat escape genocide.
* Former Republic Intelligence officer Berch Teller leads a failed attack against Imperial forces; Teller and his rebel cell steal Moff Tarkin's personal starship, the Carrion Spike, and use it to attack several Imperial facilities. Tarkin and Vader successfully hunt down and execute Teller and his compatriots, exposing Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit's collusion with the rebel cell.
* Wilhuff Tarkin is named the Empire's first Grand Moff, and given governorship over the Outer Rim Territories.

5 IE:
* Galen Erso is captured by Imperial forces.
* The planet Geonosis is secretly sterilized by the Imperial military, wiping out the Geonosian species. Geonosis is kept under strict quarantine to prevent this act from becoming public knowledge; the extinction of the Geonosians will not be revealed for several years to come.
