The following concepts are banned, and are not appable in any way, shape or form on SW: Insurgency.

* Concepts involving time travel, time-skipping, or time-dilation. We are set in our current setting for a reason, and if you do not wish to play a character that exists naturally in this timeframe, then perhaps our game is not for you.

* Non-canon races, such as Zeltrons, Hapans, Miraluka, and Ghostlings. If it didn't appear in the films or another canon source, it doesn't exist on our game.

* Droid PCs are also not currently playable. Pick an organic race please.

* Jedi Masters, Sith, and Dark Jedi

* Imperial Inquisitors

* Admirals, Generals, other high-ranking military commanders

* Canon characters (Bail Organa, Luke Skywalker, Obi-wan Kenobi, Yoda, Vader, Han Solo, etcetera)

* Planetary Leaders from planets on the playable grid, or major worlds in the SW galaxy.

If you are concerned about whether or not your concept is appropriate, please submit a +request to staff and we will review the case.
