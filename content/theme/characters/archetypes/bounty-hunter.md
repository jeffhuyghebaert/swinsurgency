Smugglers dropping their cargo at the first sign of Imperial trouble? Gamblers not paying their debts? Time to call in a Bounty Hunter. These are the beings who can find the beings that don't want to be found, and bring them back to you alive so you can do whatever you need to do ~~to~~ with them.

Bouny Hunters are expert trackers, able to use their wits and knowledge to outsmart their quarry into being in the right place at the right time to capture. Bounty Hunters aren't killers, and prefer to bring in their targets alive whenever possible; they're worth more that way. Bounty Hunting is dangerous, lonely work, and hunters need to be able to handle themselves well in a fight; usually their targets aren't the type who will just come quietly.
