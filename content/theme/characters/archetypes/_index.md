Sometimes you don't know where to start with a character, and it helps to narrow the field a bit. Here's a list of character archetypes to help you get started. These are available in Character Generation as templates to work from, with standard attributes and base skills already set. Of course, you don't have to use them as written, and can modify as you see fit.
