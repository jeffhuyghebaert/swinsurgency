We consider SW: Insurgency a 'canon' game, and primarily use thematic information derived from the Star Wars films, television shows which are established as official canon (Rebels, The Mandalorian), and other sources such as comic books and novels which are similarly established as official canon. Sources formerly included as part of the Extended Universe (now Legends) are not considered part of our canon, though we may borrow thematic elements from them as appropriate, where official canon information may be lacking.

If you have questions about whether or not certain sources or information is considered part of our game canon, please submit a +request to staff and we will review it.
