Hutts are not available as player characters, and are considered NPC-only. The reasons for this decision are many, however it can be boiled down to the fact that Hutts are largely stationary beings, who control massive fortunes and forces, and are better suited to NPC roles. They are quest-givers, background characters, and potential adversaries for the PCs, but not suitable to be PCs themselves. Players may work for them, or may be on the run from them, but cannot play them. Sorry.
