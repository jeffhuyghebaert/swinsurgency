At the end of the Clone Wars, when Chancellor Palpatine enacted Order 66, the Jedi Order was effectively destroyed. Survivors largely went into hiding, exiling themselves on backwater planets. As we know, Obi-Wan Kenobi went to Tatooine to watch over Anakin Skywalker's son, and Master Yoda retreated to the Dagobah swamp. Over the years since the Empire came to power, some Jedi have attempted to help the fledgling Rebellion against their oppressors, but most, if not all, have come to a gruesome fate at the end of Darth Vader's lightsaber, or that of his Inquisitorius.

Jedi in the early Imperial Era are fugitives not only from the laws of the Empire, but from a group of vicious and powerful warriors dedicated to their eradication. As such, smart Jedi remain in hiding. Lightsabers are banned by law, but they also serve as a beacon to the Inquisitorius, and Vader. Anyone caught with one is assumed to be a Jedi, and Imperial justice follows swiftly. Any Jedi who wishes to "hide in plain sight" as it were, must be cautious not to arouse suspicion, they must be wary of who they choose to trust, and they cannot for one second let their guard down lest they meet the same fate as the others.

This is not to say that former Jedi aren't out there, but they're being smart about it. And so should you.

Even so soon after the end of the Clone Wars, in which they played a pivotal role, the Jedi have largely faded from the public consciousness. This is in part due to Imperial propaganda, and in part due to the fact that the vast majority of the Galaxy had never seen a Jedi; there were about 1000 Jedi at the beginning of the Clone Wars, serving a galactic population in the quadrillions. Even in the Core Worlds, where Jedi were more prolific, most average beings would have never met one. Furthermore, the Empire largely forbids discussion about the Jedi and the Force; they obviously can't stop every whisper, but any mention of the Jedi or the Force has been stricken from public teachings and any official documents. Libraries and museums have been scoured clean of any reference to the Order or its members, and Jedi Temples throughout the Galaxy have been taken over and converted for use by the Empire. There remain extremely few vestiges of the Jedi Order in the Galaxy, and those that have survived are remote, well-hidden, and exceedingly rare.
