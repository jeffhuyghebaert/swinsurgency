The aftermath of the Clone Wars saw the destruction of the Jedi Order, and the fall of the Republic. In its place, the Galactic Empire rose to power under the leadership of the insidious Emperor Palpatine and his right-hand, the evil Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader. Using both the power of the Dark Side of the Force, and the devastating military might of the Imperial war machine, the Empire maintains a strangling grip on the Galaxy, crushing any hint of rebellion wherever it might crop up.

But there will always be those who will fight against oppression, despite the overwhelming odds against them. In these early days of the Empire the seeds of rebellion have been sown, and though the cost might great, these valiant Rebel fighters will do everything they can to see the Galaxy free once again.
