The Mon Calamari are a race of amphibious humanoids from the planet Mon Cala in
the Outer Rim. They are easily identifiable, with a distinct fish-like
appearance, pronounced goggle-like eyes, high-domed heads, and webbed hands and
feet. The Mon Calamari are renowned shipbuilders, known for the artistry and
aesthetic they put into their work. With the fall of the Republic and the rise
of the Galactic Empire, Mon Cala has been subjugated and occupied, its
industrial power put toward building the war machines of the Empire, and the
Mon Calamari themselves enslaved.
