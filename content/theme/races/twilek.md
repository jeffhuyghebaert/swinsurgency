special:
  Lekku: Twi'leks can use their head-tails to communicate in secret with each other, using a form of sign language. All Twi'lek are fluent in this secret language, but other species are unable to achieve full fluency due to the subtle movements used.
  Acrobatic: Twi'leks tend to be graceful, nimble creatures, and as such they receive a 0D+2 bonus to Acrobatics if they have trained in that skill.

Twi'leks are a tall humanoid species from the planet Ryloth in the Outer Rim. Their most distinguishing feature is a pair of long appendages which protrude from their skulls, called Lekku. Their physical appearance varies considerably between individuals, with skin ranging from white, yellow, green, pink, blue, purple, and range. Both genders are hairless, and generally have a higher body temperature than other species. Twi'lek females are prized throughout the galaxy as slaves, particularly in entertainment roles.
