Balosar are a humanoid species from the planet of the same name. They are
similar in appearance, but biologically distinct from humans and possess a pair
of antennapalps on top of their heads which help them to better hear sounds in
their immediate environment, and outside the range of normal human hearing.

The Balosar homeworld is all but uninhabitable, a toxic wasteland ruined by
over-industrialization and infested with crime. In fact, so prevalent is the
criminal element on Balosar that off-worlders simply tend to assume that all
Balosar are criminals.

Because of the toxic environment in which they are raised, Balosar have adapted
a high level of resistance to poisons and toxins. Their increased resistance
allows them to heavily consume narcotics without suffering the negative effects
besides addiction; as a result, many Balosar are addicted to Death Sticks,
Spice, and Ryll.
