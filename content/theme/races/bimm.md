Bimm are a diminutive mammalian humanoid species from the planet Bimmisaari,
with an average height of about 1.2 meters and an average weight around 35-40
kilograms. They are a lithe, nimble species, generally similar in appearance to
small, thin humans, but a not unsubstantial segment of the Bimm species possess
a covering of fur, and pointed ears; these furred Bimm are genetically
identical to their non-furred brethren, and their society treats them no
differently for their physical differences.

Bimm are a peaceful, musical, and artistic people who love to tell stories and
perform for a crowd. Their native language is sung, rather than spoken plainly,
which makes it difficult for non-Bimm to fully capture and understand its
nuances. Bimms tend to be found throughout the galaxy as merchants, as their
society places great value on business, bargaining, and honest dealings in
matters of commerce. Cheating and theft are among the highest crimes in Bimm
society.
