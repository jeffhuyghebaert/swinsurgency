Lannik are short, bipedal humanoids from the planet Lannik, characterized not
only by their size but by their long, droopy ears. They are known for their
aggressive nature, but also for their courage and ability to keep clear heads
in a fight. They are often times seen as fearless, but even more often as
arrogant, and not always justifiably so. Most Lannik choose to stay on their
homeworld, and they are not a particularly common sight throughout the galaxy.
