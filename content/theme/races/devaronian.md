Devaronians are a bipedal humanoid race from the planet Devaron. Male
Devaronians are hairless, and possess a pair of horns which grow from the top
of their heads, while females have a full head of hair, and no horns. Their
skin color ranges from red to green, depending on the region, and they have
red, purple, or dark brown eyes. Devaronians have black, silver-based blood,
and they possess two livers which help them filter toxins and carcinogens; as a
result they are high resistant to poisons and toxins.

Devaronian society is matriarchal, resulting from the typical differences
between the sexes; females tend to be more settled and responsible, while males
suffer from an incurable wanderlust.
