special:
  Ammonia Breathers: Gand are ammonia-breathers, and are unable to function in oxygen-rich atmospheres without the assistance of a respirator. Any Gand forced to breathe oxygen will suffer damage each round, starting at 1D+0 and increasing by 1D+0 every subsequent round.
  Regeneration: Gand are able to regenerate lost limbs; in the event of a Gand losing a limb they may make a Stamina roll once per day until the limb is fully healed. A Difficult roll or higher will result in the limb regenerating 10% of its remaining needed growth. Any roll lower than 10% means the limb did not regrow that day.

Gand are a resilient insectoid species from the the planet Gand. They are
ammonia-breathers, and must wear respirators to survive in oxygen-rich
atmospheres. Gand are easily recognizable by their stocky build, large
multi-faceted eyes, three-fingered hands and chitinous exoskeleton.

Gand are by nature a very humble species, even going so far as to refuse to use
their given names until they've proven themselves worthy of it, and never refer
to themselves in the first person, as doing so implies that anyone they might
speak to would know who they are. Until they have earned the right to use their
name, Gand refer to themselves merely as "Gand" or "This Gand". Gand are not
common throughout the galaxy, as most prefer to remain on their homeworld. The
Gand language is difficult for outsiders to understand, and much more to speak.
