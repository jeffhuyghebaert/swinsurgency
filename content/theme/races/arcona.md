The Arcona are scaleless reptiles hailing from the world of Cona. Due to their
unique biology, salt is a highly-addictive, intoxicating hallucinogen, and many
Arcona suffer from addiction to the common substance.

Arcona possess an almost hive-like sense of community, and think in terms of
their whole society and culture rather than themselves as individuals; Arcona
often refer to themselves as "we" rather than "I", even when isolated from
other Arcona. Male Arcona tend to be the calmer, more stable gender, and are
responsible for raising their young, while females tend to be more reckless and
free-spirited.
