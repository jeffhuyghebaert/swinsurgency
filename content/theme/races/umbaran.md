  Darkvision: Umbarans can see in complete darkness up to 20 meters, but cannot see color under this circumstance.

  Light Sensitivity: Umbarans are particularly sensitive to bright light, and will be blinded for one round upon exposure unless wearing protective eyewear. Because of their impaired vision in bright light, any activity which relies on vision which is performed in anything brighter than dim light suffers a 0D+2 penalty, unless the Umbaran wears appropriate eyewear.

  Perceptive: Umbarans are exceptionally perceptive when it comes to social interactions, able to detect the slightest social cues; they gain a 0D+2 bonus to social interactions.

Umbarans are a humanoid race from the planet Umbara, located in the Ghost
Nebula. They are a thin, pale people, almost frail in appearance. Umbara is a
perpetually foggy world, home to a number of dangerous flora and fauna, and the
Umbarans have evolved to suit their world, with an ability to see into the
ultraviolet spectrum, and a keen sense of awareness. Umbaran society is
caste-based, and political maneuvering is essential to their survival, leading
the Umbarans to be particularly savvy when it comes to manipulation and
persuasion.
