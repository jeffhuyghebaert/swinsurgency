Force Sensitive Iktotchi may gain a 2D+0 bonus to the Farsight skill if they are trained to use it.

The Iktotchi are a race of humanoids from the moon of Iktotchon, knows as
Iktotch. The Iktotchi are identifiable by their rough, leathery skin and
downswept horns. They are gifted pilots, stemming from having to navigate the
dangerous windstorms for which their world is known. The Iktotchi have an
innate connection to the Force; while not all Iktotchi are gifted enough to be
considered "Force Sensitive", while on Iktotch they have a natural gift for
precognition, though this talent fades considerably away from their homeworld.
