Bith are peaceful, highly-evolved beings native to the planet Clak'dor VII, and
are known for their large heads, large eyes, and long fingers. They possess
only one lung, and exhale through their skin. Bith do not sleep in the
traditional sense, instead only passing into a light meditative state during
which they remain aware of their surroundings, but are able to rest as much in
a few hours as other species can in a full night.

Bith are unable to reproduce naturally, and rely on artificial means to
fertilize and incubate a child. Bith tend to be pacifistic in nature, and excel
in academic and technical fields, rather than physical ones; their bodies are
simply ill-equipped for strenuous activities.
