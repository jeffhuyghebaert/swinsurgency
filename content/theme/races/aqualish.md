The Aqualish are a species of tusked aquatic bipeds from the planet Ando. They
have a reputation for being aggressive and rude, with a tendency to bully
weaker beings when the opportunity presents itself. Aqualish are not especially
common throughout the galaxy, as the majority choose to remain on their
homeworld; those that leave Ando can typically be found in positions which
capitalize on their more brutish tendencies, such as mercenary work or bounty
hunting.
