Nautolans are amphibious humanoid beings from the planet Glee Anselm, and are
characterized by their smooth skin which ranged in color from green to blue or
purple, large black eyes, and fourteen tentacles which gree from back of their
head. As an amphibious species, Nautolans are able to breathe air or water, and
possess excellent swimming abilities. Their head-tentacles are sensitive to
pheremones, but much of their extra-sensory abilities are lost when out of
water. Nautolan language is difficult for other species to learn, because it is
not fully pronounceable in a gaseous atmosphere, and most Nautolans choose to
speak Anselmian or Basic when travelling off-world. Few Nautolans choose to
leave Glee Anselm, and they are not common throughout the galaxy.
