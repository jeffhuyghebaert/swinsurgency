Duros are humanoid species from the planet Duro, located in the Core Worlds.
They are identifiable by their smooth blue-green skin, red eyes, and lipless
mouths, as well as their enlarged cranium. The Duros were one of the first
species to develop an interstellar hyperdrive, and are common throughout the
galaxy.

Duros are gifted pilots and explorers, and have an adventurous nature when it
comes to travelling the galaxy. Their homeworld is largely uninhabited on the
surface, primarily due to industrial pollution; the remaining fertile land on
the planet is covered with automated farms, and the Duros themselves live in
orbital cities above the planet. The Duros are known for their shipbuilding
prowess, and have been important players in the starship engineering industry
since the dawn of the Republic.
