special:
  Binary Brain: Cereans possess two brains, which are able to function independent of one another. This allows them to easily focus on two or more tasks, and the penalty for multiple actions is reduced by 0D+1 for each action performed.
  Dual Hearts: Cereans also possess two hearts, and can survive if one is damaged or destroyed; however, living with only one heart places great strain on the circulatory system, requiring twice as much rest in order to function normally.

Cereans are a humanoid mammalian species from the planet Cerea, identifiable by
their tall craniums which house binary brains. They are in most other respects
comparable to humans. Cerean males age more quickly than females, resulting in
a lower male to female ratio than in other species, and polygamous marriage is
the norm.
