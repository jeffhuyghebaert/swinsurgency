The Sith are all but unknown outside of the Jedi Order; the average galactic citizen has never heard of the Sith, have no idea who or what they are, and will never meet one of their number. Even among what remains of the Jedi, knowledge of the Sith is exceedingly rare; before Palpatine made himself known as a master of the Dark Side of the Force, there had been no documented appearances of the Sith for over 1,000 years. Leading up to the final days of the Republic, the Sith were considered little more than myth.

It's important to understand that not everyone who uses the Dark Side of the Force is a Sith. The Sith were a very specific sect of Dark Side Force-users, with their own beliefs, rituals, and rules. There are only two Sith alive in the Galaxy today; Darth Sidious, and Darth Vader. The Galaxy does not know that they are Sith, outside of the few remaining Jedi and their associates. Emperor Palpatine is known to be a powerful user of the Dark Side of the Force by his closest confidants and advisors, but the general public is entirely ignorant of this. Darth Vader's status as a powerful military leader in the Empire is public knowledge, and those of higher rank in the Empire know of this abilities as a Force user, but his identity as Anakin Skywalker, or even as a former Jedi, is not known beyond Palpatine himself, and a select few Jedi-in-exile.

If you believe your character would know anything about the Sith, consider two things. First, you're probably wrong. Two, if you're right, you're a huge target for the Empire. Please double-check with staff via +request before assuming your character has any knowledge whatsoever about the Sith.
