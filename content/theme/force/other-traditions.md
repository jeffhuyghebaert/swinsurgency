The Jedi and the Sith are not the only Force-using traditions in the Galaxy, though they are the most well known (OOCly). This is not an exhaustive list, and players are welcome to create their own Force-based tradition, within reason, though they may not resemble Force traditions found exclusively in Legends lore.

##### Guardians of the Whills

A Force-based religious order primarily based on in Jedha City on Jedha. While their members are not necessarily Force-sensitive, they believe that all life flows from Force, and every being has a destiny in the Force. After the fall of the Republic, the Guardians of the Whills dedicated themselves to the protection of Jedi lore and kyber crystal. However, the Guardians of the Whills have been unable to prevent the occupation of Jedha, and the subsequent plundering of the Temple of the Kyber.

##### Nightsisters of Dathomir

A clan of Force-wielding females on the planet Dathomir. The Nightsisters are Dark-side Force users, using their planet's natural dark energies. During the Clone Wars, the Nightsisters sold their services as mercenaries throughout the Galaxy, but by the end of the war the order was completely destroyed by General Grievous under the orders of Count Dooku. 

##### Fallanassi

Little is known about the Fallanassi order, except that they were a religious order of Force-users who became extinct some time before the start of the Clone Wars. Many of their teachings had been chronicled in sacred texts and stored in the Jedi Temple; if additional texts exist, they have yet to be discovered.
